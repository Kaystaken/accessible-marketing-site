# Refactoring Marketing Page

## Description

### Motivation

This is a company that is about search engine optimization, so if their site is not accesible in search engine results you can't trust them to be good at what they do.

### Why?

I built this project because I wanted to make the site more accessible. I also modified the html style to be semantic so it's easier to read and modify.

### Problem Solved

The site is now more accessible in search engines.
People with disabilities can now access the website using assistive technologies.

### Learnings

I learned so much during this project. Semantic html is better for readability than non-semantic html because the sections are labelled more clearly and easier to understand. When a header is described as `header` instead of `div class="header"` then it's easier to see what it represents.

I also learned that not being repetitive in css is better because when we need to update the styling it stays consistent. Otherwise a developer would need to make sure that they update every section to maintain consistent styling which is far too time consuming and easily missed.
